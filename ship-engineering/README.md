# AI Ship Engineering Research Platform

## Building the First Autonomous Ship-Engineering Ecosystem

**Distordia Labs** is pioneering AI-governed maritime design where specialized AI agents perform engineering tasks, coordinate across disciplines, and verify their work on the Nexus blockchain. We're creating the future of ship engineering—autonomous, verifiable, and data-driven.

## 🎯 Vision & Mission

### The Problem We're Solving

Modern ship design suffers from fundamental inefficiencies:

- **Siloed Disciplines**: Naval architecture, piping, HVAC, electrical, and structural engineering work in isolation
- **Integration Conflicts**: Multi-disciplinary design conflicts emerge late, requiring costly rework
- **Data Fragmentation**: Engineering data exists across multiple incompatible formats and tools
- **Verification Overhead**: Manual verification and change management consume **30-40% of project time**
- **Lack of Provenance**: Design decisions lack traceable, immutable audit trails
- **Trust Barriers**: Traditional AI operates as black boxes without verifiable accountability

### Our Solution

An **integrated ecosystem** where:
- **AI Agents (AIA)** perform specialized engineering tasks autonomously
- **Design Authority Agent (DAA)** orchestrates multi-discipline coordination
- **Interface Control Contracts (ICC)** define formal discipline boundaries
- **Knowledge Graphs** unify vessel data in machine-readable form
- **Nexus Blockchain** provides immutable audit trails and verified governance
